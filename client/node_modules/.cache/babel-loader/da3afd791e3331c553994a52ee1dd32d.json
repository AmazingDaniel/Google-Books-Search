The Vignes twin sisters will always be identical. But after growing up together in a small, southern black community and running away at age sixteen, it's not just the shape of their daily lives that is different as adults, it's everything: their families, their communities, their racial identities. Many years later, one sister lives with her black daughter in the same southern town she once tried to escape. The other secretly passes for white, and her white husband knows nothing of her past. Still, even separated by so many miles and just as many lies, the fates of the twins remain intertwined. What will happen to the next generation, when their own daughters' storylines intersect? Weaving together multiple strands and generations of this family, from the Deep South to California, from the 1950s to the 1990s, Brit Bennett produces a story that is at once a riveting, emotional family story and a brilliant exploration of the American history of passing. Looking well beyond issues of race, The Vanishing Half considers the lasting influence of the past as it shapes a person's decisions, desires, and expectations, and explores some of the multiple reasons and realms in which people sometimes feel pulled to live as something other than their origins. As with her New York Times-bestselling debut The Mothers, Brit Bennett offers an engrossing page-turner about family and relationships that is immersive and provocative, compassionate and wise.\\\"\"\n              }, void 0, false, {\n                fileName: _jsxFileName,\n                lineNumber: 31,\n                columnNumber: 30\n              }, this)]\n            }, void 0, true, {\n              fileName: _jsxFileName,\n              lineNumber: 15,\n              columnNumber: 26\n            }, this)]\n          }, void 0, true, {\n            fileName: _jsxFileName,\n            lineNumber: 10,\n            columnNumber: 22\n          }, this)\n        }, void 0, false, {\n          fileName: _jsxFileName,\n          lineNumber: 9,\n          columnNumber: 17\n        }, this)\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 8,\n        columnNumber: 17\n      }, this);\n    }) : \"No Books\"\n  }, void 0, false);\n}\n\n_c = Listitem;\nexport default Listitem;\n\nvar _c;\n\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"Listitem\");","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/test/HomeWork/googleBooksSearch/client/src/components/listItem/index.js"],"names":["React","Listitem","books","length","map","book","volumeInfo","title"],"mappings":";;;AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;;AAEA,SAASC,QAAT,CAAmB;AAAEC,EAAAA;AAAF,CAAnB,EAA+B;AAC3B,sBACI;AAAA,cACCA,KAAK,CAACC,MAAN,GAAe,CAAf,GAAmBD,KAAK,CAACE,GAAN,CAAUC,IAAI,IAAI;AAClC,0BACI;AAAK,QAAA,SAAS,EAAC,MAAf;AAAA,+BACA;AAAK,UAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA,iCACK;AAAK,YAAA,SAAS,EAAC,KAAf;AAAA,oCACI;AAAK,cAAA,SAAS,EAAC,UAAf;AAAA,sCACG;AAAK,gBAAA,GAAG,EAAC;AAAT;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBADH,eAEG;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAFH;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBADJ,eAKI;AAAK,cAAA,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAf;AAAA,sCACI;AAAK,gBAAA,SAAS,EAAC,KAAf;AAAA,wCACI;AAAK,kBAAA,SAAS,EAAC,UAAf;AAAA,0CACA;AAAA,8BAAKA,IAAI,CAACC,UAAL,CAAgBC;AAArB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,0BADA,eAErB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,0BAFqB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,wBADJ,eAKI;AAAK,kBAAA,SAAS,EAAC,qBAAf;AAAA,0CACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,0BADJ,eAII;AAAQ,oBAAA,SAAS,EAAC,MAAlB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,0BAJJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,wBALJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBADJ,eAgBI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,sBAhBJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,oBALJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADL;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cADJ;AA+BH,KAhCmB,CAAnB,GAgCM;AAjCP,mBADJ;AAsCH;;KAvCQN,Q;AAyCT,eAAeA,QAAf","sourcesContent":["import React from 'react'\n\nfunction Listitem( { books } ) {\n    return (\n        <>\n        {books.length > 0 ? books.map(book => {\n            return (\n                <div className=\"card\"> \n                <div className=\"card-body\">\n                     <div className=\"row\">\n                         <div className=\"col-md-1\">\n                            <img src=\"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-vnoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\"/>\n                            <p></p>\n                         </div>\n                         <div className=\"col-md-11 pl-5\">\n                             <div className=\"row\">\n                                 <div className=\"col-sm-4\"> \n                                 <h3>{book.volumeInfo.title}</h3>\n            <h4>Written by: {}</h4>\n                                 </div>\n                                 <div className=\"col-sm-8 text-right\">\n                                     <button>\n                                          view\n                                     </button>\n                                     <button className=\"ml-2\">\n                                          save\n                                     </button>\n                                 </div>\n                             </div>\n                           \n                             <p>\"#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER LONGLISTED FOR THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD LONGLISTED FOR THE ASPEN WORDS LITERARY PRIZE A GOOD MORNING AMERICA Book Club Pick \\\"Bennett's tone and style recalls James Baldwin and Jacqueline Woodson, but it's especially reminiscent of Toni Morrison's 1970 debut novel, The Bluest Eye.\\\" --Kiley Reid, Wall Street Journal \\\"A story of absolute, universal timelessness ...For any era, it's an accomplished, affecting novel.
